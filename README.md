# JavaWorkshops
series of constructive java Workshops
We started by creating the main class ZooManagement with integer and String variables for the number of cages and the zoo name, respectively.
Then, we allowed user input for these variables using the Scanner class, ensuring proper data handling.
We constructed classes for managing the zoo, animals, and specific animal types such as Aquatic and Terrestrial, incorporating inheritance and encapsulation concepts.
We implemented methods within the Zoo class for checking zoo capacity and comparing zoos based on the number of animals, ensuring efficient zoo management.
We created specific subclasses for Aquatic animals, such as Dolphin and Penguin, each with unique attributes and behaviors, illustrating the diversity within the animal kingdom.
Finally, we instantiated the various classes and demonstrated their functionalities within the main method, providing a comprehensive overview of the entire zoo management system and animal classification within the program.
